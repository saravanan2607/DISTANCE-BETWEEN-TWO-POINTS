# EXP-03
# DATE : 03/09/24
# DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: import math as m
### Step 2: Assign the two values
### Step 3: Apply the distance formula in the form of function as m.sqrt()
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: print the values
### Step 5: End of program


### PROGRAM:
  ``` py
#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math as m 
L1 = [4,2]
L2 = [10,6]
d =  m.sqrt((L2[0]-L1[0])**2 + (L2[1]-L1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))

```


### OUTPUT:
![EXP - 03 ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0060a8e5-9395-4903-8aba-5f0fa5888df7)



### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points are successfully executed.
