# EXP-03

# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points



## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: import math as m
### Step 2: Assign the two values
### Step 3: Apply the distance formula in the form of function as m.sqrt()
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: print the values
### Step 5: End of program


### PROGRAM:
  ``` py

import math as m 
L1 = [4,2]
L2 = [10,6]
d =  m.sqrt((L2[0]-L1[0])**2 + (L2[1]-L1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```


### OUTPUT:

![Exp-1a CR Swapping of two variables_ Attempt review - Google Chrome 15-06-2023 09_22_57 (2)](https://github.com/saravanan2607/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/121395849/e0923503-d7ba-4e11-a22c-acffa7efc1c1)


### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points are successfully executed.
